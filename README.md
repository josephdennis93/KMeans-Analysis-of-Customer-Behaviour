A KMeans Clustering analysis using the transational retail data set (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail), a "data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers."


The KMeans analysis resulted in 3 groups of customers; those who order more frequently and spend more money, a group who make smaller orders very infrequently, and another group in the middle of these two in terms of spending habits. While these groups aren't a ground-breaking classification of customers, it does help to have approximate boundaries for customer behaviour groups, and the results can be fed into a predictive model to aid in forecasting
